# Day 1: Variables & Data Types 

## 📌 What Are Variables?

Variables are containers used to store data in a program. They hold values that can change during execution.

### Example:

```python
name = "happy"
age = 20
```
Here, `name` and `age` are variables.

## 📌 What Are Data Types?

Data types define the kind of value a variable holds.

### Common Python Data Types:

* **int** → whole numbers (10, 55, -3)
* **float** → decimal numbers (3.14, 1.5)
* **str** → text ("hello", "happy")
* **bool** → True/False values
* **list** → collection of items [1, 2, 3]
* **tuple** → fixed collection (1, 2, 3)
* **dict** → key‑value pairs {"name": "Misaba"}

Variables + data types form the foundation of Python.
